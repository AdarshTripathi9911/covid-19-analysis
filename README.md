📊 COVID-19 Data Analysis Using Python
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 data to understand the spread, impact, and trends of the pandemic across different regions. The analysis focuses on key indicators such as confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries to extract meaningful insights from real-world health data.

🧹 Data Processing

The dataset was cleaned and prepared using Pandas to handle missing values, format data correctly, and ensure consistency for analysis.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to:

Identify trends in COVID-19 cases over time

Compare confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries

Understand relationships between numerical variables

📊 Data Visualization

Visualizations were created using Matplotlib to present insights clearly, including:

Line and bar charts for trend analysis

Comparative visualizations across metrics

Correlation heatmap to analyze relationships between variables

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
